I am an M.A.Sc student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at York University, working under the supervision of Dr. Hina Tabassum. My research focuses on deep learning applications in wireless communications, with particular emphasis on WiFi sensing and federated learning.

Research Interests
======
* Representation Learning
* Generative Modelling
* Deep Learning Applications in Time Series
* Federated Learning

Current Research
======
At York University, I am developing novel transformer-based architectures for multi-person activity recognition using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). This work involves:
* Designing end-to-end transformer architectures for WiFi sensing
* Optimizing attention mechanisms for temporal-spatial features
* Improving sensing metrics for complex multi-person scenarios

Previous Research Experience
======
During my time at Aalto University (Nov 2022 - Feb 2023), I worked with Dr. Alexander Jung on:
* Developing model-agnostic federated learning algorithms
* Implementing knowledge distillation techniques for federated networks
* Extending frameworks for non-networked datasets using regret minimization

Selected Projects
======
* **Self-Supervised Learning for CSI Representation Learning** (Spring 2024)
  * Developed a self-supervised learning framework for CSI data representation
  * Implemented DirectCLR approach within contrastive SSL methodologies
  * Utilized PyTorch framework with SignFi dataset

* **Evaluating AI-Generated Python Code** (Fall 2024)
  * Created a framework for evaluating LLM-generated Python code using log probabilities
  * Combined probabilistic validation with machine learning classifiers
  * Validated using HumanEval and MBPP benchmark datasets

Education
======
* M.A.Sc in Electrical and Computer Engineering, York University, 2024-Present
* B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, University of Tehran, 2018-2023
  * Thesis: Toward Model Agnostic Federated Learning
  * GPA: 3.61/4

Publications
======
* Book Chapter Contributor, Cambridge University Press (June 2024 - Dec 2024)
  * Gen AI for Communications/Networking
  * Authored sections on Gen AI fundamentals and application layer implementation

* Research paper "Personalized Federated Learning via Active Sampling" under review at Journal of Machine Learning (Springer)
