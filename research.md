## Notable Projects

### Energy-Based Transformer Models for Text Generation
**Fall 2025 - Present**

Developing energy-based transformer architectures for text generation tasks, focusing on reformulating sequence modeling as an energy minimization problem, in hope to develop system two thinkers.

### Self-Supervised Learning for CSI Representation Learning
**Spring 2024**

Implemented contrastive self-supervised learning frameworks (SimCLR, DirectCLR) for Channel State Information data representation without relying on labeled data. Demonstrated competitive performance with supervised methods while using unlabeled datasets from SignFi.

### Implementing Various Generative Models from Scratch
**Spring 2025**

During Deep Generative Modelling course, implemented various generative models from scratch including VAEs, Diffusion Models, and GANs. Focused on understanding the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of these models using PyTorch.

### AI-Generated Code Evaluation Using Log Probability
**Fall 2024**

Developed a probabilistic framework for evaluating LLM-generated Python code without execution, combining statistical analysis with ML classifiers. Validated on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, showing significant improvements in scalability over traditional execution-based testing.

### Open-set Speech Synthesizer Models Classification
**Spring 2022**

Developed a Transformer-based model for open-set synthetic speech classification using self-supervised learning (wav2vec 2.0) and a two-stage architecture for handling unknown synthesis methods. Presented at ICASSP.

### Persian Music Genre Classification
**Winter 2022**

Implemented classic ML models (XGBoost, MLP, SVM) for Persian music genre classification with full ML pipeline from data collection to evaluation using Librosa and Surfboard.
