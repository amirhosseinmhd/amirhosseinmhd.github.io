  <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a M.A.Sc candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at York University, working under the supervision of
    <a href="https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~hinat/" target="_blank">Dr. Hina Tabassum</a>. My research focuses on multi-user
    activity recognition from Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI), where I develop novel transformer-based architectures
    and self-supervised learning methods for efficient learning from wireless sensory data.
  </p>

  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>
    I am broadly interested in <strong>learning structure from sensory data at scale</strong>, which encompasses:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Representation Learning</strong> - Discovering meaningful representations from high-dimensional data</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Supervised Learning</strong> - Learning from unlabeled data without human supervision</li>
    <li><strong>World Modeling</strong> - Building predictive models of complex environments</li>
    <li><strong>Generative Modeling</strong> - Inference and synthesis from sensory data</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    My work bridges the gap between theoretical machine learning and practical applications in wireless sensing,
    with a focus on developing efficient, scalable solutions for edge devices.
  </p>
