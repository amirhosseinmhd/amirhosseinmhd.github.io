  <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a M.A.Sc candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at York University, working under the supervision of
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WAljqloAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Hina Tabassum</a>. Prior to joining York University, I completed my
    undergraduate studies at University of Tehran, where I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering majoring in Communication Systems.

  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>
    I am broadly interested in <strong>learning structure from sensory data at scale</strong>, which encompasses:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Representation Learning</strong> - Discovering meaningful representations from high-dimensional data, preferably without annotations</li>
    <li><strong>World Modeling</strong> - Building predictive models of complex environments</li>
    <li><strong>Generative Modeling</strong> - Inference and synthesis from sensory data, especially with Energy Based perspective</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    My work during master's has primarily focused on inferring from noisy sensory data, with wi-fi signals as the testbed. Looking forward, I'm interested in developing principled approaches to learning that scale across modalities and data regimes.
    I'm particularly drawn to problems where labeled data is scarce, structure is latent, and the challenge is to build systems that learn useful representations with minimal supervision.
